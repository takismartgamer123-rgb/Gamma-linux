0. CRITICAL WARNING — READ THIS OR LOSE WINDOWS
--------------------------------------------------

If you plan to Dual-Boot alongside Windows 10 or Windows 11, you MUST disable these features in Windows BEFORE booting the Gamma Linux USB:

1. Disable Fast Startup: Go to Control Panel -> Power Options -> Choose what the power buttons do -> Uncheck "Turn on fast startup".
2. Disable Hibernation: Open Command Prompt (CMD) as Administrator and run the command: powercfg /h off

Why? If left enabled, Windows mounts the drives in a locked state. This will prevent Linux from safely partitioning and can cause massive data loss. Be smart, protect your data!

--------------------------------------------------
1. WHAT IS GAMMA LINUX?
--------------------------------------------------

Gamma Linux is an ultra-minimalistic, independent meta-distribution built on top of robust Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Debian 12 Bookworm bases.

Our core mission is absolute User Freedom and environmental sustainability: breathing pristine, lightning-fast life back into older computers (from 512MB to 2GB+ RAM) that modern operating systems have completely abandoned.

* Absolute Zero Bloat Policy: No forced web browsers, no telemetry, no background metrics tracking.
* No Snaps, No Flatpaks: Clean, pure, and native packages only.
* Size: Compressed using ultra-high-ratio ZSTD-19 to keep the core OS footprint exceptionally lightweight.

--------------------------------------------------
2. EDITIONS MATRIX — v2.6.5 TANK
--------------------------------------------------

1. Gamma Legacy-32 (32-bit): Built on Debian 12 for 512MB RAM machines using Enlightenment (E17).
2. Gamma Lite-Ghost (64-bit): Built on Ubuntu 22.04 for 1GB RAM machines using Minimal Openbox + Tint2.
3. Gamma Pro-MaxMini (64-bit): Built on Ubuntu 22.04 for 2GB+ RAM machines using Openbox + EarlyOOM.

* Global Visuals: Customized Materia-Dark interface theme paired with premium Papirus-Dark icons.
* Live System Credentials: User is "gamma" and Password is "gamma".

--------------------------------------------------
3. UNIVERSAL BOOT ENGINE v2 (Hardware Detection)
--------------------------------------------------

Gamma Linux Tank Edition features a custom built-in Universal Hardware Detection Script (99gamma-auto) that triggers automatically during boot. If it detects older, historically stubborn hardware (such as legacy laptops, older Intel architectures, or early integrated AMD/Nvidia chips between 2010–2015), it automatically injects safe fallback kernel parameters (noapic, nolapic, acpi=off, nomodeset, intel_idle.max_cstate=1) to prevent hardware freezes.

--------------------------------------------------
4. QUICK INSTALLATION GUIDE
--------------------------------------------------

STEP 1: Flash the ISO
Recommended: Use Rufus written strictly in DD Image Mode (perfect for bypass-sensitive legacy BIOS systems), or deployment tools like Ventoy / BalenaEtcher.

STEP 2: Boot and Run
1. Boot into the USB media and choose Gamma Auto-Detect or Live Boot from the menu.
2. The system logs automatically into the live user "gamma".
3. Launch the graphical installer framework located directly on the desktop layout (Calamares for Debian / Ubiquity for Ubuntu bases).

STEP 3: Automated Post-Install Purge
On Ubuntu-based editions (Lite-Ghost & Pro-MaxMini), a custom background systemd service (gamma-cleanup) triggers automatically 15 seconds after your first successful post-install desktop boot to purge the deployment installer libraries, freeing up local disk space instantly.

--------------------------------------------------
5. HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------

* Legacy-32: 512MB RAM, 4GB Storage, 32-bit or 64-bit Intel/AMD CPU.
* Lite-Ghost: 1GB RAM, 6GB Storage, 64-bit CPU.
* Pro-MaxMini: 2GB+ RAM, 8GB Storage, 64-bit CPU.

6. CHECKSUMS AND VERIFICATION
--------------------------------------------------

Always verify your ISO downloads to ensure no corruption occurred during transit. Inside your download directory, run: sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt
